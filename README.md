# torchNetworks

This repository serves as a reference for a number of deep learning architectures written using the PyTorch framework.
<br> Network implementations will mostly utilise standard datasets such as: MNIST / CIFAR-10.

#### Networks:

- [ ] Neural Networks
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Networks
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Networks
- [ ] Generative Adversavrial Networks
- [ ] Variational Autoencoders
