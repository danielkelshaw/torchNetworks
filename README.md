# torchNetworks

This repository serves as a reference for a number of deep learning architectures written using the PyTorch framework.
<br> Network implementations will mostly utilise standard datasets such as: MNIST / CIFAR-10.

#### Networks:

- [x] Neural Networks
- [x] Convolutional Neural Networks
- [x] Recurrent Neural Networks
- [x] Generative Adversarial Networks
- [x] Variational Autoencoders
